# swiftpm_archive_binary_target

This sample aims to reproduce a situation where:
* we have a library A distributed as an xcframework.
* this library A is used in a swift package B that includes it as a binary target.
* our final iOS App uses our swift package B with swift package manager
* it's impossible to archieve the App because of the xcframework impossible to found

We first had issues with code signing and solved it by adding a copy framework phase then a build phase that code sign the framework A when building the App:

`codesign -f -v --sign "*********" ${CODESIGNING_FOLDER_PATH}/Frameworks/TestFramework.framework`

Now everything is fine when running in debug on device but when trying to archive the App, we have a compilation error saying Xcode doesnâ€™t find the framework A.

Steps to reproduce the issue:
1. Open the linked folder
2. Open the project located in TestPackage/TestFrameworkApp. This App use the local swift package "PackageTest", which uses the xcframework generated through the "TestFramework" project.
3. Try to archive the App
